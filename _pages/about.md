I am a PhD student at the [VITA](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/) lab at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) advised by [Prof. Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en). My research interests include deep learning and computer vision for autonomous vehicles. I have experience in vehicle trajectory prediction methods, and more recently, I'm growing an interest in video generation and world models.

I got my B.Sc. in Computer Science from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2022.
